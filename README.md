NOTE: IMPORTANT!!! Every time I release a new update I will change the name of of this project saying a new update has come out. E.g: Update 1 is out! You can delete the zip file you originally got and download it again for the new one.

This will teach you the installation of this application which will take you to a site that is not online because I am a teen and don't have money (oof).

It's very simple.

1: Open the zip file. Oh, you already had to do that to get here.
2: Double click on the index file or home/options file
3: Explore the site and stay updated!
