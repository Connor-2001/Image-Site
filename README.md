# Image-Site

This will teach you the installation of this application which will take you to a site that is not online because I am a teen and don't have money (oof).

It's very simple.

1: Open the zip file. Oh, you already had to do that to get here.
2: Double click on the index file or home/options file
3: Explore the site and stay updated!
